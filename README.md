I have 5 years of experience in IT support.

Passionate about cybersecurity, I started practicing and learning offensive security by late 2025, mainly on **HackTheBox** and through **CTF** competitions.

Currently, I'm preparing for **eJPT** (Junior Penetration Tester) and **TryHackMe PT1 certifications**.

Besides cybersecurity, I'm also learning programming having built showcase websites with HTML & CSS a few years ago, and now focusing on **Python** and **JavaScript**.
